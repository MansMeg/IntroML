## Course practicalities

Online course discussions will be held through Slack. See Studium for details on how to log in.

### Zoom

The course will most likely be taught partly through Zoom. Information and support for students can be found [here](https://mp.uu.se/c/perm/link?p=267521030). 

## Teachers

Main Teacher: Måns Magnusson

Teaching assistant: Andreas Östling

## Course structure

### Main part
The course consists of 8 blocks (weeks) of material. Each week consists of the following (expected workload in parenthesis):
- Two combined lectures/computer labs (approx. 4h per week)
- Online video material and reading assignments (approx. 2-4 h per week)
- An individual computer assignment (approx. 12-16 h per week)

### Computer assignments
Each week an individual computer assignment is done with focus in implementation of the main part of the material. Each assignment is completed individually and should follow the computer assignment template.

The computer assignments should be returned no later than **Sunday 23.59 each week**. A second possibility to turn in assignments is possible at the end of the course. For a detailed list of deadlines see the [rough course plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HC_QN2mCq9bkCPzmkP8RaR3RokFQCWo9oPuU7rFyR8Y/edit?usp=sharing).

### Machine Learning, AI and ethics
A guest lecture will be given on AI and ethics by [Karim Jebari](https://www.iffs.se/en/research/researchers/karim-jebari/).

## Course Project
The last two weeks will be focused on a course project where a group of 2-3 students choose a data and create a supervised machine learning predictor for a real-world dataset. 

Details and instructions on the project work can be found [here](https://github.com/MansMeg/IntroML/blob/master/project/).
