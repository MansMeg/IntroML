# Introduction Course in Machine Learning at Uppsala University

Welcome to the GitHub repo for the introduction course in Introduction to Machine Learning at Uppsala University. This repo contains all necessary material and information for the course.

## Course Background 
The course is given to second-year master students in the Statistics masters program. 
## Expected workload
The course takes roughly 15-25h per week, partly depending on wether the student aims for VG or not. In total the course should take roughly 200h.

## Prerequisites and Course Goals
See course syllabus [here](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course-syllabus/?kpid=39843&type=1).

Roughly the course assumes basic knowledge in linear algebra, calculus, probability theory and programming (with R or Python).

## (Rough) Course Plan
You can find a rough course plan with reading instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HC_QN2mCq9bkCPzmkP8RaR3RokFQCWo9oPuU7rFyR8Y/edit?usp=sharing).

## Schedule
You can find the course schedule on TimeEdit [here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/uu/web/schema/) (search for course code 2ST122).

## Grading
The course is graded with U (Underkänd/Fail), G (Godkänd/Pass), VG (väl godkänd/Pass with distinction).

To pass, you should pass all assignments and the mini-project. 

To get the grade VG on the course, a total of 7 or more VG points is needed. Each assignment has an additional task to complete to get VG on the assignment (and one VG-point). If the final mini-project gets VG, the students are awarded 2 VG points for the mini-project.

## Recommended workflow for each block/assignment

1. Read the literature according to the rough course plan
2. Watch the videos to get more indepth knowledge/understanding (however, optional)
3. Do the assignment

## Course practicalities

Online course discussions will be held through Slack. See Studium for details on how to log in.

### Location

The course will have 1-2 guest lectures that the guest lecturers will give through Zoom. Otherwise, the course will be held on campus. You can find information and support for students on Zoom [here](https://mp.uu.se/c/perm/link?p=267521030). 

## Teachers

Main Teacher: Måns Magnusson
Teaching assistant: Andreas Östling

## Course structure

### Main part
The course consists of rougly 8 blocks (weeks) of material. Each week consists of the following (expected workload in parenthesis):
- Two lectures/computer labs (approx. 2-4h per week)
- Online video material and reading assignments (approx. 2-6 h per week)
- An individual computer assignment (approx. 10-16 h per week)

### Computer assignments
Each week an individual computer assignment is done with a focus on implementing the main part of the material. Each assignment is completed individually and should follow the computer assignment template.

Students should return the computer assignments no later than **Sunday 23.59 each week**. A second possibility to turn in assignments is possible at the end of the course. For a detailed list of deadlines, see the [rough course plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HC_QN2mCq9bkCPzmkP8RaR3RokFQCWo9oPuU7rFyR8Y/edit?usp=sharing).

After the last (second) possible time to turn in the assignment no more chances will be given. In this case, you will be failed on the course and you will need to retake the course next year.

Each assignment will be graded and evaluated within 10 working days.

### Machine Learning, AI and ethics
A guest lecture will be given on AI and ethics by [Karim Jebari](https://www.iffs.se/en/research/researchers/karim-jebari/).

## Course Project
The last two weeks will focus on a course project where 2-3 students choose their data and create a supervised machine learning predictor for a real-world dataset. 

You can find details and instructions on the project work [here](https://github.com/MansMeg/IntroML/blob/master/project/).
