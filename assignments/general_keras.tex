\section*{Keras, Tensorflow, and Google Colab}

This assignment can be computationally heavy. If your own an old computer, you might want to run this task in the computer room in the Department or on  \href{https://colab.google/}{Google Colab}. Google Colab also enable GPU support if you want to try that.

We have setup a Jupyter Notebook with R and Tensorflow at \href{https://github.com/MansMeg/IntroML/tree/master/additional_material/colab_nb}{MansMeg/IntroML/additional\_material/colab\_nb}. We suggest \emph{not} to run the code in \texttt{markdown}. Instead, run the code in R/Colab and copy the results as output (see the assignment template for an example).

As a first step, you must install \texttt{tensorflow} and \texttt{keras} on your local computer. You can find detailed information on how to install \texttt{tensorflow} and \texttt{keras} \textbf{\href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/install/}{[here]}}. You can find details on different architecture components in the \texttt{keras} reference found \textbf{\href{https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html}{[here]}}.
