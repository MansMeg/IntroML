\section*{Keras, Tensorflow, and Google Colab}

This assignment requires \texttt{tensorflow} and \texttt{keras} for R. You can find detailed information on how to install these packages \textbf{\href{https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/install/}{[here]}}. You can find details on different architecture components in the \texttt{keras} reference found \textbf{\href{https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html}{[here]}}. \emph{Note:} you might get a message when loading \texttt{keras} that it has been deprecated in favor of \texttt{keras3}. You don't need to install \texttt{keras3} instead, but if you do, it works also.

As a first step, try to install everything locally on your own computer. If you do not get that to work properly, we have set up a Jupyter Notebook with R and Tensorflow \href{https://github.com/MansMeg/IntroML/tree/master/additional_material/colab_nb}{[link]} in \href{https://colab.google/}{Google Colab} as a backup. If using Colab, we suggest \emph{not} to run the code in \texttt{markdown}. Instead, run the code in R/Colab and copy the results as output (see the assignment template for an example). Google Colab also enable GPU support if you want to try that.
